# Frequently asked questions

Here's a list of the most common questions.

## Is advanced query understanding supported?

Yes, Microsoft Search parses query intent from larger phrases. This feature uses AI to learn common superfluous phrases users add to their queries that don't affect their search intent. For example, when a user searches for *tell me more about how to change my password*, we extract the less important words from the query and trigger based on the relevant ones like *change password*.
  
This feature won't override keywords set in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com).
  
## Can you search for files on-premises?

Yes. You can search on-premises [SharePoint](http://sharepoint.com/) files if you have a hybrid deployment of SharePoint.

## Can I search across federated organizations?

No.

## Where can I get info about Office 365 security, compliance, and privacy?

Details can be found on the [Trust Center pages for Office 365](https://www.microsoft.com/TrustCenter/CloudServices/office365/default.aspx).

## Can guests access Microsoft Search in my organization?

Microsoft 365 enables rich collaboration with people outside of your organization through [guest access.](/microsoft-365/solutions/collaborate-with-people-outside-your-organization) These users can search for documents, sites, groups, lists, and libraries. However, guests won't get the full, personalized Microsoft Search experience and may need to use the on-page search box instead of the unified Microsoft Search box in the header.
